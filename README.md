# JS Code Quiz

## This Repository

This repository is where I have created a simple JS Code Quiz website as an assignment for a coding bootcamp.  The objective of this code is to practice DOM traversal and manipulation, using event listeners, arrays, objects, and local storage.

## Use

When you click the start button, the timer will start and the first question will display.  You have 50 seconds to answer 5 questions.  If you answer a question incorrectly, 5 seconds will be deducted from your time.  When the timer reaches 0 or when you have answered each question, the remaining time will be your score.  You can input your initials and save your score.  The "View Highscores" button at the top left will display all the scores on your local storage.
